title: Using public-key crypto remains difficult

[Pretty Good Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy), released in
1991, was probably one of the first software packages to make public-key cryptography
available for regular users. Until then, crytography was mainly used by banks, soldiers
and researchers. Public-key cryptography is a very powerful technique that plays
a key role in securing the Internet. Despite of its importance, we still face issues
to deploy it to all Internet users. The [recent release of Adobe security team's 
private key](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/in-spectacular-fail-adobe-security-team-posts-private-pgp-key-on-blog/) on a public web page is one example
of this difficulty, but by far not the only one.

In a [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08555v1.pdf) published in 2015, S. Ruoti and his colleagues analysed the useability of [Mailenveloppe](https://www.mailvelope.com/en/), a
popular mail client that includes PGP support. Their results were disappointing since
only 10% of the survey participants were able to carry out the tasks that they were
assigned to by using encrypted email. We still have a useability problem with
public-key cryptography for the masses...
