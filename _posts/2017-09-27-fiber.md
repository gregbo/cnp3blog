title: Even more bandwidth accross the oceans
tag: microsoft, facebook, optical, fiber

Fiber optics play a key role in Wide Area Networks. With very small exceptions, most of
the links that compose WANs are composed of optical fibers. As the demand for bandwidth 
continues to grow, network operators and large cloud companies continue to deploy
new optical fiber links, both on the ground and accross the oceans. The latest 
[announcement](https://news.microsoft.com/features/microsoft-facebook-telxius-complete-highest-capacity-subsea-cable-cross-atlantic/) came from Microsoft and Facebook. Together, they
have commissioned a new fiber optical link between Virginia Beach, Virginia (USA) 
and Bilbao, Spain. The landing points chosen for this fiber are a bit unusual since
many of the fiber optic cables that cross the Atlantic Ocean land in the UK
for obvious geographical reasons. This new cable brings 160 Terabits/sec of capacity and
adds diversity to the fiber routes between America and Europe. This diveristy is beneficial
against unexpected failures but also against organisations that captures Internet
traffic by [tapping optical fibers as revealed by Edward Snowden](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa).

Additional information about the many other optical fibers that have been laid under the
oceans may be found in the detailed maps collected by [Telegeography](https://www.telegeography.com). Datacenterknowledge.com published recently a nice [summary](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2017/03/03/here-are-the-submarine-cables-funded-by-cloud-giants) of the submarine cables funded by cloud companies.
